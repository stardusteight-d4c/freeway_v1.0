# freeway_v0.1
Project for a version of the Freeway game programmed at Alura. 
I used the HTML5 <canvas> element and its JavaScript API to manipulate images, 
  control audio streams and render images by capturing the HTML5 <img> element with the
  getElementById() method and assigning it to a variable, later being manipulated with the 
  ctx.drawImage() method.
